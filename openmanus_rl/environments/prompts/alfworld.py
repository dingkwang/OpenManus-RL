Please begin by analyzing the situation and planning your approach:

<think>
Analyze the current situation and devise a plan to accomplish the task: {task_description}
What are the key steps needed to complete this task?
Based on the current observation, what should be our immediate next step?
How does this action advance our plan toward completing the task?

From now on, I will provide you with observations after each action, and you should respond with memory recall, reflection, thinking, and your next action in this format:

<memory_recall>
[Recall relevant past experiences and reasoning from our conversation history]
- What similar situations have I encountered?
- What strategies worked or failed before?
- What objects or locations have I discovered?
- What was my previous reasoning and plans?
</memory_recall>

<reflection>
[Reflect on the last action and its outcome]
- What did my last action accomplish?
- Was it successful or did it encounter issues?
- How does this outcome affect my plan?
- Am I making progress toward the task goal?
</reflection>

<think>
[Plan the next step based on memory and reflection]
- Given what I've learned, what should I do next?
- How does this action fit into my overall strategy?
- What do I expect this action to achieve?
</think>
